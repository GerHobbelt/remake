	* NEWS, src/debug.h, src/main.c, src/print.c, src/remake.c: When
	debugger enabled, enter debugger when target needs to be remade.

2005-11-13 Sunday 13:23  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* src/: dbg_cmd.c, main.c, trace.h: Any tracing or "enter"
	debugging now sets GNU Makefile "basic" debug listing.

2005-11-13 Sunday 00:56  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* po/: da.po, de.po, es.po, fr.po, gl.po, he.po, hr.po, ja.po,
	ko.po, nl.po, pl.po, pt_BR.po, ru.po, sv.po, tr.po, zh_CN.po: I
	guess these are part of CVS.

2005-09-28 Wednesday 05:23  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* config/Makefile.am: Looks like I need readline.h as well.

2005-04-26 Tuesday 00:14  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* src/misc.c: From Rich Paul:
	
	Sometimes routines allocate objects of type dep_t using xmalloc,
	and not initializing all of the members:  the specific issue
	noticed was that the ignore_mtime field, which marks a target as an
	'order only' target is not always initialized.	You can recognize
	that this is happening by doing a make -p, and look for target
	lines like:
	
	>> tgt:  dep1 | dep2
	
	The dependency dep1 and it's ilk are normal deps, but changes to
	dep2 and friends will not (if I understand order only targets
	properly) cause tgt to be rebuilt ... their only contribution is
	that if, for some reason, dep2 and tgt are rebuilt, the dep2 target
	will be completed before tgt is started.
	
	The problem is NOT limited to dep_t structures: if rather than
	initializing all malloc'd memory to 0, I initialize it to 0xff, the
	resulting make cannot even parse it's own src/Makefile: it fails
	with a 'missing separator' message ... this appears to be a
	separate bug in read.c, which has, as of yet, eluded me.

2005-04-16 Saturday 23:01  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* NEWS, configure.ac, config/readline.h, config/readline.m4,

	more readline variations.  Patches from Rich Paul.

	bug # 9748
	
	remake.c: add complain() from make CVS.

2004-10-17 Sunday 16:44  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* src/remake.c: Tracking make changes of 28 Sept 2004:	    
	Implemented dontcare flag inheritance when rebuilding makefiles.
	
	Note: tests/scripts/features/include change deferred for now. (So
	maybe this doesn't work.)

2004-10-17 Sunday 16:42  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* po/.cvsignore: .cvsigore *.po for now.

2004-10-17 Sunday 16:34  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	locations.

	with gdb's command set.
	
	print list - now prints a target, print target no longer does print
	and examine save last string given added info variables separated
	info and show. "info" is the same as "help info" We stay in
	debugger after a Maekfile exits.  Some subroutine renaming done.

2004-06-26 Saturday 22:17  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* src/job.c: Go into the debugger when we recieve a signal.

2004-06-26 Saturday 22:16  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* src/remake.c: Go into the debugger when we've finished a
	makefile.

2004-06-26 Saturday 22:15  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* src/remake.c: Improve target-stack tracking. Still could be
	better and cleaner.

2004-06-24 Thursday 09:23  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* src/dbg_cmd.c: Add ability to print specified attributes of a
	target, e.g. "time", "deps", "vars"
	
	Same thing we did in print.c: If target doesn't have a location but
	it has commands that do, use those to derive the target location.

2004-06-24 Thursday 09:19  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* src/print.c: When printing location, If the target is an absolute
	filename, don't prepend starting-directory.  starting-directory is
	only needed if a relative filename.
	
	When printing target. If we don't have location info for the target
	but do have location info for the commands it runs, use that to
	derive a target location. (Right now we assume the target is the
	line before the line that the commands start.)

2004-06-24 Thursday 09:15  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* doc/makedb.txt: Cover the debugger's prior bugs.

	versions.

2004-06-18 Friday 01:51  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* src/: commands.c, commands.h: Make set_file_variables public.

	be set by make, i.e.  ignnore-errors, keep-going, silent.
	
	Hack in fix for duplicate 0 history entry.
	
	Allow $@ as target name in "write" command.
	
	Add internationalization for many strings.
	
	com_...() -> dbg_cmd_..() to match bash debugger. Hey, why not?

2004-06-15 Tuesday 08:14  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* src/: job.c, job.h: Add doxygen comment on prototype

2004-06-15 Tuesday 01:23  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* configure.ac: Now is 0.2cvs

2004-06-13 Sunday 19:49  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* src/dbg_cmd.c: Expand the way set works.  "set *var* *val*" is
	now "set variable *var* *val*" so we can accomodate
	
	set basename {on|off|toggle| set trace {on|off|toggle}

2004-06-12 Saturday 22:05  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* configure.ac: Wrong readline variable set.

	* glob/: Makefile.in, glob.c, .deps/fnmatch.Po, .deps/glob.Po:

2004-04-04 Sunday 12:44  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* tests/scripts/features/errors: We now report a more precise line
	number.

2004-04-04 Sunday 12:40  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* job.c, main.c, make.h, misc.c: Adjust for the command line number
	when giving an error.

2004-04-04 Sunday 02:05  Rocky Bernstein <rocky@panix.com>

	* po/: Makefile, Makefile.in, POTFILES: Remove derived files.

	tests/scripts/features/errors, tests/scripts/options/dash-k: First
	batch of changes.
	
	We now save line number information at run-time and have a call
	stack.	Error messages which give a location now appear more often.
	
	On error we can give a stack trace if option --extended-errors (-E)
	was set.
	
	We also have POSIX shell "set -x" like call tracking with the
	option --trace (-x).
