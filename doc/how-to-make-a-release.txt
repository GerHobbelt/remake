  e.g. bashdb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net; no major changes before

- "make distcheck" should work - (but it doesn't at present)

- Go over Changelog and add NEWS. Update date of release.

- Remove "cvs" from configure.ac's release name. E.g.
    AC_INIT(remake,3.80+dbg-0.3cvs,rocky@panix.com)
                               ^^^
    ...

    cvs update -dPA .
    cvs commit .

- autogen.sh && make && make check

- make doxygen documentation
  cd doc/doxygen; ./run_doxygen

- Tag release in CVS: 
   cvs log -h configure.ac
   cvs tag release_<0_3> . (replace <0_3> with the right value)

- "make distcheck" one more time

- Upload files to upload.sourceforge.net, 
  ftp upload.sourceforge.net, 
    user anonymous, 
    password (your email address)

      with "rm" and "cvs remove"
    for each new "?" html add it
  cvs commit .
