Most of what's here are things I know need to be done. Volunteers are
welcome. I'll probably do only the things that either most interest me
or I most want to have. So even though something below may be a major
gap, Things marked :-( are important but something I'll probably live
with.


:-( Should have remote invocation interface so debugger command loop
can live outside of the make environment. With this global state like
breakpoints would survive across forks and subshells returns. Without
that, something hacky for saving and passing state as is done in the
bash debugger has to be done. For now, I'll probably live with no
global state.

:-( Create breakpoint-list data structure so we can report what breakpoints
are in effect, or reset them on a restart.

:-( Debugger history commands.

:-( Add a debugger profile mechanism. (Should be a stack of file
descriptors so profiles can nest).

Redo command parsing. Make more like gdb. 
  trace -> set trace
  set foo bar -> set variable foo = bar
  add set annotate

More debugger regression tests.

Expand/rewrite debugger documentation as texinfo. 

:-( Allow breakpoint on file:line. 

MAKELEVEL seems buggy

better line info stored for commands 

:-( Add ddd support. (Although I have CVS commit ability for ddd in
case someone submits a patch.)

Run until recursive call? 

:-( breakpoint actions? 

More sophisticated debugger inquiries such as comparing two target
timestamps, listing targets that need remaking.

There are probably many make-specific commands (e.g like the ones
listed above). Using the debugger will probably uncover many areas.
such as specialized things to trace.
